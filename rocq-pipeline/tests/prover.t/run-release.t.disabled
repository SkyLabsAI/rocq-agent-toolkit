Basic test for `auto-prover`.
Here, unlike `run.t`, we assume that both Python and Rocq dependencies are
already installed.
This test is disabled by default, but CI for releases will enable it.

The tests are otherwise the same, and `./regen-run-release.sh` can be used to
keep them in sync.

Copy dune project from source tree to separate folder:

  $ cp $TESTDIR/dune-project $TESTDIR/dune $TESTDIR/*.v .

Run installed `auto-prover`:

  $ auto-prover foo.v
