Rocq Document Manager
=====================

This utility can be used to programmatically edit a Rocq source file.

Usage Summary
-------------

The document manager can be started by running with the following command.
```sh
rocq-doc-manager [ROCQ_ARGS] FILE
```
In effect, the document manager expects the same command-line arguments as the
`rocq compile` command does.

Once the document manager is running, it can be interacted with using JSON-RPC
2.0 requests wrapped in a simple transfer protocol layer. The document manager
waits for request packages on its `stdin`, and sends the corresponding replies
to its `stdout`. Request are handled sequentially, and in order.

Transfer Protocol
-----------------

Packets sent to / received from the document manager have the following shape.
```
Content-Length: <size>\r\n\r\n<data>
```
The data part is a JSON string complying to the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol, and the
size part gives the size of the JSON string in bytes.
