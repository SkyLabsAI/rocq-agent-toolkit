Rocq Term Dependencies Plugin
=============================

This Rocq plugin provides the following new vernacular command:
- `DepsOf` giving the list of constants and inductives that are immediately
  used in the definition of the given constant.
- `DepsOfJSON` doing the same thing, but outputing JSON format.
